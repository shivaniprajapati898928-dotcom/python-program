 Pandas Series
A Pandas Series is one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, Python objects etc.). The axis labels are collectively called indexes.

Pandas Series is created by loading the datasets from existing storage which can be a SQL database, a CSV file or an Excel file. It can be created from lists, dictionaries, scalar values, etc.

Example: Creating a series using the Pandas Library.


import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np

ser = pd.Series() 
print("Pandas Series: ", ser) 

data = np.array(['g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's']) 
  
ser = pd.Series(data) 
print("Pandas Series:\n", ser)
Output:

2. Pandas DataFrame
Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is created by loading the datasets from existing storage which can be a SQL database, a CSV file or an Excel file. It can be created from lists, dictionaries, a list of dictionaries etc.

Example: Creating a DataFrame Using the Pandas Library


import pandas as pd 
   
df = pd.DataFrame() 
print(df)

lst = ['Geeks', 'For', 'Geeks', 'is', 'portal', 'for', 'Geeks'] 
  
df = pd.DataFrame(lst) 
print(df)
